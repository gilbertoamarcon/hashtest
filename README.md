# HashTest

A golang hashing method test.

This test creates a set of randomly generated structs and tests multiple hashing methods that turn the structs into a fixed-size string hash.

The test evaluates the total time duration taken by each method, whether the method succeeded in generating collision-free hashes, and the total size of the hash set. 

Example usage:
```
./build_and_run.sh
```
